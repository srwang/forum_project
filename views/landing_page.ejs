//clear cookies at the top of the JS
//make it so that the cookie stores username, password upon creation *and* log-in
//use username to grab userID from sql, and then pass that into topics/comments

//users will only be able to post if they are logged in (i.e. if cookie exists)
//make the top logo reflect the fact that a user is logged in or not
